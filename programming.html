<h2>Programming Structures:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sequentail Structure: Top-down Execution</li>
    <li>Decision Structures: If/Then/Else</li>
    <li> Iterative (Looping):
        <ul>
            <li>While Loop: Continue Looping As Long Something Is True</li>
            <li>Repeat/Until Loop: Continue Looping Until Something Is True</li>
            <li>For Loop: Loop A Given Number Of Times</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Recursive Structures:
        <ul>
            <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself.</li>
            <li>Repetition continues until:
                <ul>
                    <li>degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met (degenerative case is also called a "base case")</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Two Classic programming/database problems</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Sorting:
<ul>
    <li>Descending order/ Ascending order</li>
    <li>Sorting numbers</li>
    <li>Sorting strings (in accordace with ASCII values)</li>
</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Searching:
<ul>
    <li>find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li>
    <li>In database:
        <ul>
            <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
            <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
</ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Two popular search techniques:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
    <li>Binary search:
        <ul>
            <li>only works if data is SORTED first.</li>
            <li>Start in the midle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Two Classic program goals:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Efficiency: program takes minimal tme and/or resources</li>
    <li>Correctness: program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software testing and verfication</h2>

    <tr><th><h4>Kinds Of Tests:</h4></th></tr>
    <tr style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%;">
		<th>TESTS</th>
        <th>DEFINITION</th>
    <tr>
        <td>Acceptance testing</td>
        <td>A test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Integration testing</td>
        <td>The phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Unit testing</td>
        <td>A way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Functional testing</td>
        <td>A quality assurance process and a type of black-box testing that bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Performance testing</td>
        <td>A non-functional software testing technique that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of an application holds up under a given workload.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Regression testing</td>
        <td>Re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs as expected after a change.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Stress testing</td>
        <td>A software testing activity that determines the robustness of software by testing beyond the limits of normal operation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Usability testing</td>
        <td>A method of testing the functionality of a website, app, or other digital product by observing real users as they attempt to complete tasks on it.</td>
    </tr>

<h2>Software testing is done to detect:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Architectural flaws.</li>
    <li>Poor design decisions.</li>
    <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality.</li>
    <li>Security vulnerabilities functionality.</li>
    <li>Scalability issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing best practices:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Continous testing:
<ul>
    <Li>Project teams test each build as it becomes available.</Li>
    <Li>This type of software testing relies on test automation that is integrated with the deployment process.</Li>
    <Li>It enables software to be validated in realistic test environments earlier in the process-improving design and reducing risks.</Li>
</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Configuration management:
<ul>
    <li>Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test.</li>
    <li>Teams gain access to assets such as code, requirements, design documents, models, test scripts and test results.</li>
    <li>Good systems include user authentication and audit trails to help teams meet compliance requirements with minimal administrative effort.</li>
</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Service virtualization:
<ul>
    <li>Testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development.</li>
    <li>Service virtualization simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner.</li>
    <li>They can reuse, deploy and change a configuration to test different scenarios without having to modify the original environment.</li>
</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Defect or bug tracking:
<ul>
    <li>Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality.</li>
    <li>Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues.</li>
</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Metrics and reporting:
<ul>
    <li>Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results.</li>
    <li>Advanced tools integrate project metrics and present results in a dashboard.</li>
    <li>Teams quickly see the overall health of a project and can monitor relationships between test, development and other project elements.</li>
</ul>
    </li>
</ul>
